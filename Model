Plan

#So for this Project I want to use the Pokemon Dataset that I got from Kraggle~
#This data set has the tables with a name of that pokemon , what kind of type the pokemon is, 2 types = type1, type2, 
#The main Database includes with Generation and a boolean weather the pokemon is a legendary or not.
#This dataset is a great use when it comes to teaching people more about pokemon and what kind they are, weather what type of the pokemon is, what generation the pokemon is
#IF its legendary or not.
